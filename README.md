# www.crola1702.site source code

Hi! This repository contains the source code of my personal site.
I use it primarily to register the projects I work on,
the events I assist, some articles and tutorials I make
and reviews from books I like.

## Small docs

### Generate translations

The binary `*.mo` files are generated by running:

```bash
pybabel compile --directory theme/translations --domain messages
```

> To generate `*.po` files, you can write a `messages.pot` file and then run:
> `pybabel init --input-file theme/translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.pot --output-dir theme/translations/ --locale es --domain messages`
>
> I don't use `pybabel extract` because most templates generate dynamic content based on pelican variables,
> so mapping doesn't show more translations than the ones written manually.
