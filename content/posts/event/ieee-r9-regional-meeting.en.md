I was one of the students attendants to the IEEE R9 Regional Meeting, one of the most important regional meetings in IEEE that was hold in Paipa, Colombia in 2024. As part of this event I was able to connect with other students and professionals, also giving me the opportunity to meet with the IEEE 2023-2024 president, Tom Coughlin (**correct the spelling**), and different global IEEE directive members. This was a great opportunity to motivate myself into being a professional IEEE member.
