In Colombia, 3000 of 3600 organs that need to be transplanted, are kidneys. This is a big problem, as sometimes the kidney is transplanted. However, _el transplante se pierde_, as sometimes the times to react to changes in physiological variables is not enough.

Pame App (internal name for the application) is an app that aids to the constant monitoring of the transplanted kidney.
